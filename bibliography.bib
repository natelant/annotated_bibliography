abstract = {Autonomous taxi (AT) fleets have the potential to take over a significant amount of traffic handled nowadays by conventionally driven vehicles (CDV). In this paper, we simulate a city-wide replacement of private cars with AT fleets of various sizes. The simulation model comprises microscopic demand for all private car trips in Berlin (including incoming and outgoing traffic), out of which the internal ones are exclusively served by ATs. The proposed real-time AT dispatching algorithm was optimized to handle hundreds of thousands of vehicles and millions of requests at low computing times. Simulation results suggest, that a fleet of 100 000 vehicles will be enough to replace the car fleet in Berlin at a high service quality for customers. Based on this, one AT could replace the demand served by ten CDVs in Berlin.},

abstract = {Mobility as a Service (MaaS) is the integrated and on-demand offering of new mode-sharing transport schemes, such as ride-share, car-share or car-pooling. MaaS schemes may solve some of the most pressing mobility problems in large conurbations like London. However, MaaS schemes pose significant implementation challenges for operators and city authorities alike. With the existing transport and traffic planning tools, even basic questions do not have easy answers: e.g. how many vehicles are needed; how should they be deployed; what infrastructure changes are needed, and what will happen with congestion? This paper reports on the novel integration, through co-simulation of two independent agent-based simulators: MATSim and IMSim. MATSim generates realistic transport demand for a city: allocating travellers to the best mobility option according to their preferences; while IMSim provides a highly realistic operational execution of autonomous and manually driven transport fleets. We show how the simulation tools complement each other to deliver a superior Autonomous Mobility on Demand (AMoD) modelling capability. By combining the two, we can evaluate the impact of diverse AMoD scenarios from different standpoints: from a traveller's perspective (e.g. satisfaction, service level, etc.); from an operator's perspectives (e.g. cost, revenue, etc.); and from a city's perspective (e.g. congestion, significant shifts between transport modes, etc.). The coupled simulation methods have underpinned the extensive MERGE Greenwich project investigation into the challenges of offering ride-share services in autonomous vehicles in the Royal Borough of Greenwich (London, UK) for travellers, service-operators, the city, and vehicle manufacturers.},

Several modeling efforts have been reported in the literature on the demand side (with sophisticated activity-based models that focus on an individual's day activity patterns) and on the supply side (with detailed representation of network dynamics through simulation-based dynamic traffic assignment models). This paper proposes an extension to a state-of-the-art integrated agent-based demand and supply model—SimMobility—for the design and evaluation of autonomous vehicle systems.

Results based on 100 different random seeds shows that the relative accuracies of estimated link loads tend to increase with link load, but that relative errors of up to 10 {\%} do occur even for links with large volumes. Although the proportion of links having large relative errors is roughly the same for all of the investigated seeds, it is shown the variations of individual link loads between seeds largely dominate variations between the two last iterations within a seed.},

abstract = {Technologic advancements have contributed to the spread of sharing economy concepts, a developing phenomenon that favors the shift from private mobility to service-use (shared mobility). One-way carsharing is a most recent and popular kind of shared mobility, that is growing and developing rapidly in various forms. These systems are considered to have a transformative impact on future urban transportation. Despite all of the benefits that have been reported from the use of new one-way carsharing (e.g. Autonomous Mobility-on-Demand systems), their impacts on the mobility are not certain yet. This comes from the fact that in such services supply and demand influence each other in a significant way in short-, mid-, and long-term. Also service characteristics at the level of each vehicle strongly affect the demand. In this paper methods, paradigms, toolkits and platforms used in the literature for the demand estimation of the new one-way carsharing systems, as well as their potential drawbacks are discussed. A review of the literature reveals that despite the considerable number of studies related to balancing vehicle stocks across stations in one-way systems, the investigation about demand estimation of such services for which the complex relationship between supply and demand is considered, remain very limited. The majority of current platforms and toolkits used for demand estimation of new one-way carsharing systems are based on activity-based multi-agent simulations. In these simulations several main components are not yet taken into account, which could dramatically change the results. Data detail, accessibility and reliability, high computational time, calibration and validation still remain major challenges for travel demand estimation for one-way carsharing systems.},

The assignment-based strategy produced better results for both drivers (less idle driving) and passengers (less waiting).

(2005 Journal of Economic Behavior and Organization, 56, 489-512). The CATS model has been extensively used to replicate a large number of scaling types stylized facts with a remarkable degree of precision. For such purposes, the simulation of the model has been performed entering ad hoc parameter values and using the same initial set up for all the agents involved in the experiments. Nowadays alternative robust and reliable validation techniques for determining whether the simulation model is an acceptable representation of the real system are available. Moreover many distributional and goodness-of-fit tests have been developed while several graphical tools have been proposed to give the researcher a quick comprehension of actual and simulated data. This paper discusses some validation experiments performed with the modified CATS model. In particular starting from a sample of Italian firms included in the CEBI database, we perform several ex-post validation experiments over the simulation period 1982-2000. In the experiments, the model parameters have been estimated using actual data and the initial set up consists of a sample of agents in 1982. The CATS model is then simulated over the period 1982-2000. Using alternative validation techniques, the simulations' results are ex-post validated with respect to the actual data. The results are promising in that they show the good capabilities of the CATS model in reproducing the observed reality. Finally we have performed a first calibration experiment via indirect inference, in order to ameliorate our estimates. Even in this case, the results are interesting. {\textcopyright} Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2007.},

abstract = {Limiting private cars' use while promoting sustainable modes of transport is one of the main challenges of urban transport planning. In this context, characterized by scarce resources and increasing demand for mobility, Demand Responsive Shared Transport (DRST) services can bridge the gap between shared low-quality public transport and unsustainable individual private transport. Taking advantage of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT), they can supply transport solutions ranging from flexible transit to ride sharing services, providing real-time “on demand” mobility through fleets of vehicles shared by different passengers. The optimal design of a DRST service requires a trade-off among efficiency (from the operators' point of view), service quality (from the users' point of view) and sustainability (from the community's point of view). In this paper, an agent-based model (ABM) fed with GIS data is used to explore different system configurations of a specific type of DRST service, i.e. flexible transit, and to estimate the transport demand and supply variables that make the service feasible and convenient. The model reproduces a mixed fixed/flexible route transit service with different fleet size and vehicle capacity in the city of Ragusa (Italy) with the aim to: (i) make a first test of the ABM model with GIS-based demand and road network models; (ii) explore different vehicle dispatching strategies; (iii) find appropriate indicators to monitor the service quality and efficiency. Simulation results show the impact of fleet composition and route choice strategy on the system performance. In particular, they show an optimal range of operating vehicles that minimizes a total unit cost indicator, accounting both for passenger travel time and vehicle operation cost. By reproducing the microinteraction between demand and supply agents (i.e. passengers and vehicles), it is possible to monitor the macroscopic behaviour of the system, and derive useful suggestions for the correct planning, management and optimization of DRST services.},

abstract = {23.1 Introduction The recent technological advancements in ICT (Information and Communications Technology) provide novel, on-line eeet management tools, opening up a broad range of possibilities for more intelligent transport services: :exible, demand-responsive, safe and energy/cost eecient. Signii-cant enhancements can aid in both traditional transport operations, like regular public transport or taxis and introduction of novel solutions, such as demand-responsive transport or personal rapid transport. However, the growing complexity of modern transport systems, despite all beneets, increases the risk of poor performance, or even failure, due to lack of precise design, implementa-tion and testing. One solution is to use simulation tools ooering a wide spectrum of possibilities for validating transport service models. Such tools have to model, in detail, not only the dynamically chang-ing demand and supply of the relevant service, but also traac cow and other existing transport services, including mutual interactions/relations between all these components. Although several approaches have been proposed (e.g., Regan et al., 1998; Barcelo et al., 2007; Liao et al., 2008; matsim Matsim{\_}Book 2016/6/29 20:26 Page 146 {\#}154 146 The Multi-Agent Transport Simulation MATSim Certicky et al., 2014), as far the author knows, no existing solutions provide large-scale microscopic simulation that include all the components above. 23.2 DVRP Contribution To address the problem above, MATSim's DVRP (Dynamic Vehicle Routing Problem) contribution has been developed. The contribution is designed to be highly general and customizable to model and simulate a wide range of dynamic vehicle routing and scheduling processes. Currently, the domain model is capable of representing a wide range of one-to-many and many-to-many VRPs; one can easily extend the model even further to cover other speciic cases (see Section 23.3). Since online optimization is the central focus, the DVRP contribution architecture allows plugging in of various algorithms. At present, there are several diierent algorithms available, among them an algorithm for the Dynamic Multi-Depot Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows and Time-Dependent Travel Times and Costs, analyzed in (Maciejewski and Nagel, 2012), and a family of algorithms for online taxi dispatching, studied in (Maciejewski and Nagel, 2013b,c,a; Maciejewski, 2014). The DVRP contribution models both supply and demand, as well as optimizing geet operations, whereas MATSim's core is used for simulating supply and demand, both embedded into a large-scale microscopic transport simulation. In particular, the contribution is responsible for: • modeling the DVRP domain, • listening to simulation events, • monitoring the simulation state (e.g., movement of vehicles), • least-cost paths, • computing schedules for drivers/vehicles, • binding drivers' behavior to their schedules, and • coordinating interaction/cooperation between drivers, passengers and dispatchers.},

abstract = {The activity-based model system is being coined as the next-generation demand-forecasting model. The agent-based transport simulation tool-kit MATSIM is a fully integrated system that models decisions from the long term to the short term, and these decisions in MATSIM are activity-based models. This paper describes the application of MATSIM in a large-scale multiagent-based transport simulation for Shanghai, China. First, algorithms for integrating new data in Shanghai with MATSIM inputs such as synthetic population, facilities, and network are separately designed according to data characteristics. Then activity-based modeling is introduced to generate population plans, and activity replanning is employed to learn the better travel plans; a utility-based approach is used to model scoring for a plan. Finally, a full MATSIM-based simulation platform for the Shanghai scenario is built in detail. The scenario contains 200,000 synthetic persons simulated on a network with 50,000 links. The relaxed state of the simulation system is reached after 100 iterations of replanning procedures, and the mode choice, route choice, and activity time allocation modules are used to optimize agents' activity plans. The feasibility of transport simulation in Shanghai by MATSIM is validated against the mode split and the observed counts. Extensive simulation results for the designed Shanghai simulation scenarios indicate that most of the observed counts match quite well with the traffic simulation volumes and demonstrate the potential of MATSIM for large-scale dynamic transport simulation.},

@article{Ziemke2019,
abstract = {With more diverse transport policies being proposed and the advent of novel transport services and technologies, the transport system is becoming more individualized in many aspects. Transport models, the most important tool to assess policies and schemes, need to be sufficiently expressive to address these developments. Agent-based transport models, where travelers with individual properties and the ability to act and decide autonomously are resolved individually, allow to appropriately model and analyze such policies. This paper describes the MATSim Open Berlin Scenario, a transport simulation scenario for the Berlin metropolitan area implemented in the agent-based transport simulation framework MATSim. The scenario is solely based on open data and the demand for transport is created based on a fully synthetic procedure. Contrary to most transport simulation scenarios, no information from a travel diary survey is required as input. As such, the scenario generation procedure described in this study is spatially transferable and facilitates the creation of agent-based transport simulation scenarios for arbitrary regions.},
