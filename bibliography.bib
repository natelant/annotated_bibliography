 abstract = {The MATSim (Multi-Agent Transport Simulation) software project was started around 2006 with the goal of generating traffic and congestion patterns by following individual synthetic travelers through their daily or weekly activity programme. It has since then evolved from a collection of stand-alone C++ programs to an integrated Java-based framework which is publicly hosted, open-source available, automatically regression tested. It is currently used by about 40 groups throughout the world. This book takes stock of the current status.The first part of the book gives an introduction to the most important concepts, with the intention of enabling a potential user to set up and run basic simulations.The second part of the book describes how the basic functionality can be extended, for example by adding schedule-based public transit, electric or autonomous cars, paratransit, or within-day replanning. For each extension, the text provides pointers to the additional documentation and to the code base. It is also discussed how people with appropriate Java programming skills can write their own extensions, and plug them into the MATSim core.The project has started from the basic idea that traffic is a consequence of human behavior, and thus humans and their behavior should be the starting point of all modelling, and with the intuition that when simulations with 100 million particles are possible in computational physics, then behavior-oriented simulations with 10 million travelers should be possible in travel behavior research. The initial implementations thus combined concepts from computational physics and complex adaptive systems with concepts from travel behavior research. The third part of the book looks at theoretical concepts that are able to describe important aspects of the simulation system; for example, under certain conditions the code becomes a Monte Carlo engine sampling from a discrete choice model. Another important aspect is the interpretation of the MATSim score as utility in the microeconomic sense, opening up a connection to benefit cost analysis.Finally, the book collects use cases as they have been undertaken with MATSim. All current users of MATSim were invited to submit their work, and many followed with sometimes crisp and short and sometimes longer contributions, always with pointers to additional references.We hope that the book will become an invitation to explore, to build and to extend agent-based modeling of travel behavior from the stable and well tested core of MATSim documented here.},

abstract = {Autonomous taxi (AT) fleets have the potential to take over a significant amount of traffic handled nowadays by conventionally driven vehicles (CDV). In this paper, we simulate a city-wide replacement of private cars with AT fleets of various sizes. The simulation model comprises microscopic demand for all private car trips in Berlin (including incoming and outgoing traffic), out of which the internal ones are exclusively served by ATs. The proposed real-time AT dispatching algorithm was optimized to handle hundreds of thousands of vehicles and millions of requests at low computing times. Simulation results suggest, that a fleet of 100 000 vehicles will be enough to replace the car fleet in Berlin at a high service quality for customers. Based on this, one AT could replace the demand served by ten CDVs in Berlin.},

abstract = {Mobility as a Service (MaaS) is the integrated and on-demand offering of new mode-sharing transport schemes, such as ride-share, car-share or car-pooling. MaaS schemes may solve some of the most pressing mobility problems in large conurbations like London. However, MaaS schemes pose significant implementation challenges for operators and city authorities alike. With the existing transport and traffic planning tools, even basic questions do not have easy answers: e.g. how many vehicles are needed; how should they be deployed; what infrastructure changes are needed, and what will happen with congestion? This paper reports on the novel integration, through co-simulation of two independent agent-based simulators: MATSim and IMSim. MATSim generates realistic transport demand for a city: allocating travellers to the best mobility option according to their preferences; while IMSim provides a highly realistic operational execution of autonomous and manually driven transport fleets. We show how the simulation tools complement each other to deliver a superior Autonomous Mobility on Demand (AMoD) modelling capability. By combining the two, we can evaluate the impact of diverse AMoD scenarios from different standpoints: from a traveller's perspective (e.g. satisfaction, service level, etc.); from an operator's perspectives (e.g. cost, revenue, etc.); and from a city's perspective (e.g. congestion, significant shifts between transport modes, etc.). The coupled simulation methods have underpinned the extensive MERGE Greenwich project investigation into the challenges of offering ride-share services in autonomous vehicles in the Royal Borough of Greenwich (London, UK) for travellers, service-operators, the city, and vehicle manufacturers.},

Results based on 100 different random seeds shows that the relative accuracies of estimated link loads tend to increase with link load, but that relative errors of up to 10 {\%} do occur even for links with large volumes. Although the proportion of links having large relative errors is roughly the same for all of the investigated seeds, it is shown the variations of individual link loads between seeds largely dominate variations between the two last iterations within a seed.},

abstract = {Technologic advancements have contributed to the spread of sharing economy concepts, a developing phenomenon that favors the shift from private mobility to service-use (shared mobility). One-way carsharing is a most recent and popular kind of shared mobility, that is growing and developing rapidly in various forms. These systems are considered to have a transformative impact on future urban transportation. Despite all of the benefits that have been reported from the use of new one-way carsharing (e.g. Autonomous Mobility-on-Demand systems), their impacts on the mobility are not certain yet. This comes from the fact that in such services supply and demand influence each other in a significant way in short-, mid-, and long-term. Also service characteristics at the level of each vehicle strongly affect the demand. In this paper methods, paradigms, toolkits and platforms used in the literature for the demand estimation of the new one-way carsharing systems, as well as their potential drawbacks are discussed. A review of the literature reveals that despite the considerable number of studies related to balancing vehicle stocks across stations in one-way systems, the investigation about demand estimation of such services for which the complex relationship between supply and demand is considered, remain very limited. The majority of current platforms and toolkits used for demand estimation of new one-way carsharing systems are based on activity-based multi-agent simulations. In these simulations several main components are not yet taken into account, which could dramatically change the results. Data detail, accessibility and reliability, high computational time, calibration and validation still remain major challenges for travel demand estimation for one-way carsharing systems.},

The assignment-based strategy produced better results for both drivers (less idle driving) and passengers (less waiting).

(2005 Journal of Economic Behavior and Organization, 56, 489-512). The CATS model has been extensively used to replicate a large number of scaling types stylized facts with a remarkable degree of precision. For such purposes, the simulation of the model has been performed entering ad hoc parameter values and using the same initial set up for all the agents involved in the experiments. Nowadays alternative robust and reliable validation techniques for determining whether the simulation model is an acceptable representation of the real system are available. Moreover many distributional and goodness-of-fit tests have been developed while several graphical tools have been proposed to give the researcher a quick comprehension of actual and simulated data. This paper discusses some validation experiments performed with the modified CATS model. In particular starting from a sample of Italian firms included in the CEBI database, we perform several ex-post validation experiments over the simulation period 1982-2000. In the experiments, the model parameters have been estimated using actual data and the initial set up consists of a sample of agents in 1982. The CATS model is then simulated over the period 1982-2000. Using alternative validation techniques, the simulations' results are ex-post validated with respect to the actual data. The results are promising in that they show the good capabilities of the CATS model in reproducing the observed reality. Finally we have performed a first calibration experiment via indirect inference, in order to ameliorate our estimates. Even in this case, the results are interesting. {\textcopyright} Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2007.},

@article{Inturri2019,
abstract = {Limiting private cars' use while promoting sustainable modes of transport is one of the main challenges of urban transport planning. In this context, characterized by scarce resources and increasing demand for mobility, Demand Responsive Shared Transport (DRST) services can bridge the gap between shared low-quality public transport and unsustainable individual private transport. Taking advantage of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT), they can supply transport solutions ranging from flexible transit to ride sharing services, providing real-time “on demand” mobility through fleets of vehicles shared by different passengers. The optimal design of a DRST service requires a trade-off among efficiency (from the operators' point of view), service quality (from the users' point of view) and sustainability (from the community's point of view). In this paper, an agent-based model (ABM) fed with GIS data is used to explore different system configurations of a specific type of DRST service, i.e. flexible transit, and to estimate the transport demand and supply variables that make the service feasible and convenient. The model reproduces a mixed fixed/flexible route transit service with different fleet size and vehicle capacity in the city of Ragusa (Italy) with the aim to: (i) make a first test of the ABM model with GIS-based demand and road network models; (ii) explore different vehicle dispatching strategies; (iii) find appropriate indicators to monitor the service quality and efficiency. Simulation results show the impact of fleet composition and route choice strategy on the system performance. In particular, they show an optimal range of operating vehicles that minimizes a total unit cost indicator, accounting both for passenger travel time and vehicle operation cost. By reproducing the microinteraction between demand and supply agents (i.e. passengers and vehicles), it is possible to monitor the macroscopic behaviour of the system, and derive useful suggestions for the correct planning, management and optimization of DRST services.},

abstract = {Carpooling is an emerging alternative transportation mode that is eco-friendly and sustainable as it enables commuters to save time, travel resource, reduce emission and traffic congestion. The procedure of carpooling consists of a number of steps namely (i) create a motive to carpool, (ii) communicate this motive with other interested agents, (iii) negotiate a plan with the interested agents, (iv) execute the agreed plans and (v) provide a feedback to all concerned agents. The state-of-the-art research work on agent-based modeling is limited to a number of technical and empirical studies that are unable to handle the complex agent behavior in terms of coordination, communication and negotiations. In this paper we present a conceptual design of an agent-based model (ABM) for the carpooling application that serves as a proof of concept. Our agent-based model for the carpooling application is a computational model that is used for simulating the interactions of autonomous agents and to analyze the effects of change in factors related to the infrastructure, behavior and cost. In our agent-based carpooling application we use agent profiles and social networks to initiate our agent communication model and then employ a route matching algorithm and a utility function to trigger the negotiation process between agents. We plan to, as a part of the future work, develop a prototype of our agent-based carpooling application on the basis of the work presented in this paper. Furthermore, we also intend to carry out a validation study of our results with real data. {\textcopyright} 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

The procedure of carpooling consists of a number of steps namely; (i) create a motive to carpool, (ii) communicate this motive with other agents, (iii) negotiate a plan with the interested agents, (iv) execute the agreed plans, and (v) provide a feedback to all concerned agents. The state-of-the-art research work on agent-based modeling is limited to a number of technical and empirical studies that are unable to handle the complex agent behavior in terms of coordination, communication and negotiations. In this paper, we present a conceptual design of an agent-based model (ABM) for the carpooling a that serves as a proof of concept. Our model for the carpooling application is a computational model that is used for simulating the interactions of autonomous agents and to analyze the effects of change in factors related to the infrastructure, behavior and cost. In our carpooling application, we use agent profiles and social networks to initiate our agent communication model and then employ a route matching algorithm, and a utility function to trigger the negotiation process between agents. We plan to, as a part of the future work, develop a prototype of our agent-based carpooling application based on the work presented in this paper. Furthermore, we also intend to carry out a validation study of our results with real data. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.},

The system simulates the operation of a dynamic dial-a-ride service that operates with multiple fleets of vehicles with different capacities, schedules and depots. It can be used to investigate how the setting of service and cost parameters and the design of the service affect the total cost for the operator and level of service for the customer.

abstract = {23.1 Introduction The recent technological advancements in ICT (Information and Communications Technology) provide novel, on-line eeet management tools, opening up a broad range of possibilities for more intelligent transport services: :exible, demand-responsive, safe and energy/cost eecient. Signii-cant enhancements can aid in both traditional transport operations, like regular public transport or taxis and introduction of novel solutions, such as demand-responsive transport or personal rapid transport. However, the growing complexity of modern transport systems, despite all beneets, increases the risk of poor performance, or even failure, due to lack of precise design, implementa-tion and testing. One solution is to use simulation tools ooering a wide spectrum of possibilities for validating transport service models. Such tools have to model, in detail, not only the dynamically chang-ing demand and supply of the relevant service, but also traac cow and other existing transport services, including mutual interactions/relations between all these components. Although several approaches have been proposed (e.g., Regan et al., 1998; Barcelo et al., 2007; Liao et al., 2008; matsim Matsim{\_}Book 2016/6/29 20:26 Page 146 {\#}154 146 The Multi-Agent Transport Simulation MATSim Certicky et al., 2014), as far the author knows, no existing solutions provide large-scale microscopic simulation that include all the components above. 23.2 DVRP Contribution To address the problem above, MATSim's DVRP (Dynamic Vehicle Routing Problem) contribution has been developed. The contribution is designed to be highly general and customizable to model and simulate a wide range of dynamic vehicle routing and scheduling processes. Currently, the domain model is capable of representing a wide range of one-to-many and many-to-many VRPs; one can easily extend the model even further to cover other speciic cases (see Section 23.3). Since online optimization is the central focus, the DVRP contribution architecture allows plugging in of various algorithms. At present, there are several diierent algorithms available, among them an algorithm for the Dynamic Multi-Depot Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows and Time-Dependent Travel Times and Costs, analyzed in (Maciejewski and Nagel, 2012), and a family of algorithms for online taxi dispatching, studied in (Maciejewski and Nagel, 2013b,c,a; Maciejewski, 2014). The DVRP contribution models both supply and demand, as well as optimizing geet operations, whereas MATSim's core is used for simulating supply and demand, both embedded into a large-scale microscopic transport simulation. In particular, the contribution is responsible for: • modeling the DVRP domain, • listening to simulation events, • monitoring the simulation state (e.g., movement of vehicles), • least-cost paths, • computing schedules for drivers/vehicles, • binding drivers' behavior to their schedules, and • coordinating interaction/cooperation between drivers, passengers and dispatchers.},

abstract = {The activity-based model system is being coined as the next-generation demand-forecasting model. The agent-based transport simulation tool-kit MATSIM is a fully integrated system that models decisions from the long term to the short term, and these decisions in MATSIM are activity-based models. This paper describes the application of MATSIM in a large-scale multiagent-based transport simulation for Shanghai, China. First, algorithms for integrating new data in Shanghai with MATSIM inputs such as synthetic population, facilities, and network are separately designed according to data characteristics. Then activity-based modeling is introduced to generate population plans, and activity replanning is employed to learn the better travel plans; a utility-based approach is used to model scoring for a plan. Finally, a full MATSIM-based simulation platform for the Shanghai scenario is built in detail. The scenario contains 200,000 synthetic persons simulated on a network with 50,000 links. The relaxed state of the simulation system is reached after 100 iterations of replanning procedures, and the mode choice, route choice, and activity time allocation modules are used to optimize agents' activity plans. The feasibility of transport simulation in Shanghai by MATSIM is validated against the mode split and the observed counts. Extensive simulation results for the designed Shanghai simulation scenarios indicate that most of the observed counts match quite well with the traffic simulation volumes and demonstrate the potential of MATSIM for large-scale dynamic transport simulation.},

abstract = {With more diverse transport policies being proposed and the advent of novel transport services and technologies, the transport system is becoming more individualized in many aspects. Transport models, the most important tool to assess policies and schemes, need to be sufficiently expressive to address these developments. Agent-based transport models, where travelers with individual properties and the ability to act and decide autonomously are resolved individually, allow to appropriately model and analyze such policies. This paper describes the MATSim Open Berlin Scenario, a transport simulation scenario for the Berlin metropolitan area implemented in the agent-based transport simulation framework MATSim. The scenario is solely based on open data and the demand for transport is created based on a fully synthetic procedure. Contrary to most transport simulation scenarios, no information from a travel diary survey is required as input. As such, the scenario generation procedure described in this study is spatially transferable and facilitates the creation of agent-based transport simulation scenarios for arbitrary regions.},

Not only the replacement of conventional passenger cars by automated ones but also other forms of mobility offers are being discussed, such as the introduction of vehicle-on-demand fleets. When investigating the effects of such systems, the changes in the perceived travel time have to be regarded. Within this paper, the effects of introducing automated vehicles as well as vehicle-on-demand and shared vehicle-on-demand offers are presented. Eight different simulation settings with different fleet sizes and shares of private automated vehicles were evaluated using an agent-based demand model. The factors for value of time were obtained from a stated preference user survey. The results show only minor changes in the modal split and the amount of rides for the city of Brunswick due to the relatively small travel distances prevailing.},

These systems are known as paratransit systems and have experienced large increases in number and average size over the past 15 years. We first use a national database and standard time series techniques to model aggregate demand. We then use a unique data set of administrative records from a paratransit system in central Virginia to estimate standard and nonstandard count models of individual demand. We conclude that most of the demand growth is from new passengers, but that predicting the growth of new passengers is very difficult. Our results also highlight the importance of incorporating autocorrelation and possible sample attrition into standard count models. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {In recent years the accessibility of London buses has improved with the introduction of ramps and wheelchair priority areas. These advances are meant to remove physical barriers to entering the bus, but new conflicts have arisen particularly over the physical space aboard. We aimed to research the barriers faced by wheelchair users in public transport using a mixed methods approach to establish the breadth of issues faced by wheelchair users. To this end we quantified the push-force used alight a bus and a study to understand the coping mechanisms used by people to propel up a ramp. This quantitative approach found push forces which resulted in a load of 2 to 3 times body weight being transferred through people's shoulders, forces which can be directly linked to shoulder injury. This could disable the user further, preventing them from being able to push their wheelchair. Alongside the quantitative study, we conducted qualitative research comprising of a number of in-depth interviews with wheelchair users about the barriers they face in public transport. Our main claim, highlighted through this interdisciplinary collaboration, is that proposed ‘solutions' to accessibility, such as ramps, often generate problems of their own. These barriers can affect the life of wheelchair users, impacting on their confidence and causing social isolation. These can be long-term in nature or immediate.},

Building upon two prior studies from the Institute of Medicine (the 1991 Institute of Medicine's report Disability in America and the 1997 report Enabling America), The Future of Disability in America examines both progress and concerns about continuing barriers that limit the independence, productivity, and participation in community life of people with disabilities. This book offers a comprehensive look at a wide range of issues, including the prevalence of disability across the lifespan; disability trends the role of assistive technology; barriers posed by health care and other facilities with inaccessible buildings, equipment, and information formats; the needs of young people moving from pediatric to adult health care and of adults experiencing premature aging and secondary health problems; selected issues in health care financing (e.g., risk adjusting payments to health plans, coverage of assistive technology); and the organizing and financing of disability-related research. The Future of Disability in America is an assessment of both principles and scientific evidence for disability policies and services. This book's recommendations propose steps to eliminate barriers and strengthen the evidence base for future public and private actions to reduce the impact of disability on individuals, families, and society.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Safety is a primary concern for the visually impaired when navigating unfamiliar urban environments. Since most environments are constructed to be easily navigated by sighted people, visually impaired people have to often seek help and use secondary clues to navigate many urban environments safely. As a result, daily activities such as using transit systems remain challenging tasks for people with visual impairments even though the use of transit systems is often a key factor for participation in employment, and educational, social, and cultural opportunities. Visually impaired adults have several challenges when navigating unfamiliar environments. First, they must pre-plan their navigation routes as much as possible and need to build a mental map of the new environment they will be navigating. Next, they need to figure out how to navigate between locations of interest from a known environment. They also need to be informed of dynamic changes to the unfamiliar environment which may impact their safe navigation. Furthermore, they need to be able to " record " their navigation experience for future trips and also potentially share this information with others who might find it useful. Finally, if they get into any unsafe or difficult situation while navigating the unfamiliar environment, they need to have a reliable means of getting help. We have been exploring specific needs and constraints encountered by this user population when using transit stations. Based on our findings, we created a set of design guidelines for useful technology targeting this user population and prototyped an accessible smartphone tool that has significant potential to enhance the safety of these travelers. This tool allows travelers to annotate their paths and choose/invite trusted sources to enhance the relevant information that can enhance the safety and efficacy of their travel.},

Second, the types of vehicle modifications and state-of-the-art controls that are available and on the horizon are described and the way in which these technologies are selected to meet driver needs is explained. Requirements for driver safety systems for drivers who remain in their wheelchairs are then discussed. Finally, emerging and innovative driving enhancement systems, such as obstacle avoidance and navigation, are discussed, as are their benefits in helping drivers who have disabilities and elderly drivers to experience safe and independent driving. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.
