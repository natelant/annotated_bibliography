\section{Background}

Cities across the world are concerned with understanding and forecasting the
impacts of modern mobility systems. These systems --- including dockless bike
and scooter sharing, ridehailing via Transportation Network Companies (TNC),
flexible route transit systems, and others --- promise to greatly improve, or at
least transform, urban mobility throughout the 21st century. As currently
deployed however, such systems often presuppose a certain level of individual
ability that not all transportation system users can achieve. Individuals who
are physically disabled have reported difficulties using many of these systems
(CITE CHRISTENSEN) For example, blind individuals may not be able to use a TNC's
mobile application, or a TNC driver's vehicle is likely inadequate to transport
individuals who use wheelchairs.
