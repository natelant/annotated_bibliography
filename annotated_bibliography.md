## Autonomous taxicabs in Berlin â€“ a spatiotemporal analysis of service performance  (Joschka Bischoff, Michal Maciejewski, 2016)
This article was a post study from a very similar study in Berlin.

They tested the effect on traffic from empty cars and demand shift as people switch from public transit.

They show how they scale from the 100% base scenario to the 10% without describing how they scaled down trip rates and network capacity (maybe described in previous paper).

Helpful graphics include the passenger waiting times during time of day, the productivity of the vehicles during time of day, and spatial distribution of waiting times and empty rides.

They found 10% of transit riders switched to autonomous taxis (only measured on the city center model, no outskirts). No explanation was given.
