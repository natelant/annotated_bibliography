# Introduction
Cities across the world are concerned with understanding and forecasting the impacts of modern mobility systems. These systems — including dockless bike and scooter sharing, ridehailing via Transportation Network Companies (TNC), flexible route transit systems, and others — promise to greatly improve, or at least transform, urban mobility throughout the 21st century. As currently deployed however, such systems often presuppose a certain level of individual ability that not all transportation system users can achieve. Individuals who are physically disabled have reported difficulties using many of these systems (Bascom and Christensen, 2017). For example, blind individuals may not be able to use a TNC’s mobile application, or a TNC driver’s vehicle is likely unsuitable for passengers who use wheelchairs. Seeing the opportunity afforded by modern mobility systems (especially TNCs) and the inability of some citizens to access them, some transportation agencies have begun to explore methods to improve system access for all users. These methods have included subsidized rides, driver training programs, and others. In one notable program, Lyft and the Utah Transit Authority (UTA) have proposed to offer wheelchair-dependentindividuals the opportunity to hail a wheechair-accessibile vehicle (WAV) through the Lyft application. Under the proposed agreement, Lyft drivers could serve the requests using a fleet of four WAVs provided under agreement with UTA. UTA would train the drivers to operate the special equipment and interface with wheelchair-dependent passengers. 

A program such as that proposed by UTA with Lyft faces many legal and regulatory challenges, but it also faces non-trivial technical challenges related to understanding the relationship between supply and demand. What, for example, is the likely relationship between fleet size, fare, and level of service? A larger fleet will serve requests more quickly, but might be too expensive to operate. A smaller fleet might be too inconvenient for anyone to rely on for daily travel. Other questions surround the algorithm used to pair requests for trips with drivers; an optimal algorithm might achieve equivalent levels of service with a smaller fleet. These technical questions could be resolved, or at least rigorously studied, with a transportation supply and demand microsimulation. In this proposed research project, we will extend the robust, commonly-used transport microsimulation engine MATSim (Hornietal.,2016) to model on-demand WAV mobility systems.
